# JavaScript Basics in Express - Manchester Codes - Chris Peakin - Oct 2021 Cohort

## Introduction

This is an extension of the Javascript Basics repo, as part of the Backend module of the Manchester Codes Software Engineer fast-track course.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` in your terminal to install the dependencies. 

Download Postman if you haven't already; a link is provided below.

## Testing

Run `npm test` to run the provided tests.

## Using Postman

Run `npm start` in your terminal, and then open Postman.

Once Node is running (the terminal should say that the Express app is running at http://localhost:3000), you can use Postman to GET or POST requests to the server.

For example sending a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/numbers/add/12/and/8` will produce a result of 20. The other functions as shown in the `./src/lib/` files can be run too.
